    "description": "Epilepsy is usually only diagnosed after a person has had more than one seizure and not all seizures are due to epilepsy.

There are over half a million people with epilepsy in the UK, so around 1 in 100 people. Other conditions that can look like epilepsy include fainting, or very low blood sugar in some people being treated for diabetes.
